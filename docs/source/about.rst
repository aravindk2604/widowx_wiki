About
=====
This documentation describes the setup of Trossen Robotics' WidowX ARM with ROS.
It was tested on ``Ubuntu 16.04`` and ``ROS Kinetic``.
The content is adapted from the original documentation from Trossen Robotics.

If you would like to setup the ARM and ID the servos then you should start with the original documentation that can be found `here <http://learn.trossenrobotics.com/interbotix/robot-arms/widowx-arm>`_.

The WidowX Robot Arm Mark II is the update to Interbotix Labs' entry level arm offering for the MX series of DYNAMIXEL Servos. The Mark II has a few improvements that we've made based upon our own testing as well as customer feedback. We've upgraded the elbow servo from an MX-28 to an MX-64 complete with custom aluminum brackets for added frame strength, replaced the Arbotix with the new Arbotix-M, and streamlined the arm structure to be lighter, simpler, and stronger. The MX series actuators provide a full 360 degree freedom of movement in the base, ultra-high resolution of 4096 positions, user-definable PID parameters, and extremely smooth interpolation. The hefty MX-64 shoulder & elbow servos gives the WidowX very strong lifting strength in a slim frame. If you are looking for medium lifting strength and desire smooth control, high accuracy and repeat-ability the WidowX is a great mid-level arm choice.
